VCF is a text file format (most likely stored in a compressed manner). It contains meta-information lines, a header
line, and then data lines each containing information about a position in the genome. The format also has the ability
to contain genotype information on samples for each position. 

Based on the specification found at: https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/blob/master/VCFv4.2.pdf
