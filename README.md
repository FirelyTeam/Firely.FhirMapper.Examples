This project holds logical models, maps, and examples used to transform (C)-CDA documents to FHIR.

Content:
- Examples: CDA documents which can be used for testing of the (C)-CDA to FHIR transformation. It also contains the expected transformation targets in the form of FHIR bundles.
- StructureDefinition: StructureDefinitions for FHIR R4 representing a (C)-CDA documents and its corresponding data types. 
- Mappings: FHIR Mapping Language files and StructureMap resources representing the mapping between (C)-CDA and FHIR. Additionally, a ConceptMap is included documenting which (C)-CDA elements can be mapped to FHIR.

The documentation of the how to execute these mappings with the Firely FHIR Mapper can be found [here](http://docs.simplifier.net/mappingengine/index.html).
