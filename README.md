The FHIR Mapper is an implementation of the [FHIR mapping language](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-language.html), developed by [Firely](https://fire.ly) and [Healex](https://healex.systems), available as a Vonk plugin on the [Vonk marketplace](https://fire.ly/products/vonk/plugins/). With this add-on you're able to transform data from a variety of formats - HL7 v2 or your custom ones - to other formats such as FHIR/custom resources. It can even be used to map FHIR resources between different profiles and FHIR versions.

More general information and tutorials about the FHIR Mapping Language can be found on the [HL7 wiki](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Mapping+Language).
